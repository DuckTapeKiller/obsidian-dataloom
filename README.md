DataLoom is an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) plugin for desktop and mobile. It allows you to create databases similar to [Notion.so](https://notion.so).

As of **2025-02-19**, we are working on a new version that will use Svelte instead of React. The update will include changes to how data is stored and rendered within the plugin.

## Network Usage

According to [Obsidian developer policies](https://docs.obsidian.md/Developer+policies), an Obsidian plugin must explain which network services are used and why.

DataLoom will make one `GET` request to `https://api.github.com/repos/decaf-dev/obsidian-dataloom/releases/latest` to pull the latest release for the What's New Modal. Besides this, DataLoom does not make any network requests. DataLoom does not include client-side telemetry.

## License

## Disclaimer

This plugin extends the functionality of Obsidian.md. Although tested during development, there may still be bugs in the software. I **strongly** recommend you to make frequent backup copies of your vault. I am not responsible for any data that is lost due to the usage of this plugin.
