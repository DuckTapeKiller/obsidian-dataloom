## Notice

DataLoom is [no longer maintained](https://github.com/decaf-dev/obsidian-dataloom/issues/958).

Please [export](https://dataloom.xyz/basics/export) any existing DataLoom files into raw markdown format. This will make your data available with the native Obsidian table editor.

If you run into any problems with exporting, please open a [bug report](https://github.com/decaf-dev/obsidian-dataloom/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug). I will promptly respond and fix the issue.

As alternatives to DataLoom, I recommend the following plugins:

-   [Vault Explorer](https://github.com/decaf-dev/obsidian-vault-explorer)
-   [Projects](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects)

For basic table usage, I recommend just using the native Obsidian table editor.
